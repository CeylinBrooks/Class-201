## Chapter 5: “Images”

- Images can be used to set the
tone for a site in less time than
it takes to read a description.

- As a website grows, keeping
images in a separate folder
helps you understand how the
site is organized.

- To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). 

- src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site

- alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

- title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image.

- align 
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image.

## Chapter 11: “Color” 

- These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
hex codes
- These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
- There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers.

- hue
This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
saturation

- lightness
This is expressed as a
percentage with 0% being white,
50% being normal, and 100%
being black.

## Chapter 12: “Text”

- Serif
Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs.
In print, serif fonts were
traditionally used for long
passages of text because they
were considered easier to read.
- Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.
Screens have a lower resolution
than print. So, if the text is small,
sans-serif fonts can be clearer
to read.
- Monospace
Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)
Monospace fonts are commonly
used for code because they align
nicely, making the text easier to
follow.

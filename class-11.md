# From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 16: “Images” 

- Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

- You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

- Where the <img> elements
appear in the HTML, rather
than using width and height
attributes you can use these
names as values for the class
attribute

- images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.

- The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

- The background-repeat
property can have four values:
repeat
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).

- repeat-x
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

- repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically
only.

- no-repeat
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:

-fixed
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.


## Chapter 19: “Practical Information” 

- Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.

- On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.

-Off-Page Techniques
Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.

 1: Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the <title> element which lives
inside the <head> element.
2: URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.
3: Headings
If the keywords are in a heading
<hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.
4: Text
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.
5: Link Text
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").
6: Image Alt Text
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.
7: Page Descriptions
The description also lives inside
the <head> element and is
specified using a <meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results

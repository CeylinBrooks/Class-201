# From the Duckett HTML book:

#### <ol>
- The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
#### <li>
- Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
-Browsers indent lists by default.

#### <ul>
- The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element.
#### <li>
- Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

####<dl>
- The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
- Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.
#### <dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
####<dd>
- This is used to contain the

## Boxes

- By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.

- width, height
- min-width, max-width
- min-height, max-height
- overflow

#From the Duckett JS book:

- You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

- The first lines of code on the left
create an array containing a list
of three colors

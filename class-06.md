# From the Duckett JS book:

*Chapter 3: “Object Literals”*

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.
- If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
**property.**
- If a function is part of an object, it is called a **method.**
- Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a va lue. In an object,
that name is called a **key.**

*Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”*

- The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

- The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
- The DOM specifies the way in which the
browser should structure this model using
a **DOM tree.**
- The terms *elements* and *element nodes* are used interchangeably
but when people say the DOM is working with an element,
it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

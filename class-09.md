## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 7: “Forms” 

- Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
- HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.
- The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.
- There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.
- A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
- A form may have several form controls, each
gathering different information. The server
needs to know which piece of inputted data
corresponds with which form element.

- <form>
Form controls live inside a
<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.
action
- Every <form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.
method
- Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.
  
## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms”

- There are several CSS properties that
were created to work with specific types
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,
and forms.
- The list-style-type property
allows you to control the shape
or style of a bullet point (also
known as a marker).
- It can be used on rules that
apply to the <ol>, <ul>, and <li>
elements.

##Chapter 2: "Basic JavaScript Instructions"

A script is series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow 
The *semicolon* also tells the JavaScript interperter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.
Statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as **code blocks**

Write *comments* to explain what your code does
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change each time the script is run.
**A variable needs a value assigned to it. **

### DATA TYPES
 - Numeric Data Types 
 - String Data Type
 - Boolean Data Type (only true/false)
 
 You can use a techinique called *"escaping"* the quotation characters
 
 Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
1
The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
4
All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.
2
The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
5
Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.
3
You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.
ONLINE EXTRA

reserved words in JavaScript.
6
If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).


#Chapter 4 "Decisions and Loops"

- Flowcharts can help you plan for these ocassions (decisions making)
- There are two components to a decision:  1.An expresssion is evaluated, which returns value. 2. A condtional statement says what to do in a given situation.
- == is equal to
- != is not equal to
- === strict equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- > great than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal to
- <= less than or equal to

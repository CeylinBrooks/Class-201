# From the Duckett HTML book:

##Links


- Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
  between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.
  
-   The text between the opening
    <a> tag and closing </a> tag
     is known as link text.
     
- Links are created using the <a>
  element which has an attribute
  called href.
     
- **Users can click on anything that
appears between the opening
<a> tag and the closing </a>
tag and will be taken to the page
specified in the href attribute. **

- When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL

- URL (or Uniform
Resource Locator)

-The <h1> element is used with an id attribute at the top of the page so
that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom of the page to
the top

##Layout 

### *Controlling t XX he position of elements, Creating site layouts and Designing for different sized screens*

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

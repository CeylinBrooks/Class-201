#From the Duckett HTML book:

Chapter 6: “Tables”

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

<table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
<tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.
<td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.
Some browsers automatically
draw lines around the table
and/or the individual cells. 


#From the Duckett JS Book:

Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

On the right, an empty object
called hote 1 is created using the
constructor function.
Once it has been created, three
properties and a method are
then assigned to the object

Once you have created an object
(using literal or constructor
notation), you can add new
properties to it.

# Domain Modeling:
* https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling *

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. 
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
